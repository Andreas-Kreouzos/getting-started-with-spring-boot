# Getting Started with Spring Boot

This is my repository in creating my first Spring Boot application by enrolling into
amigoscode omonymous course. During this course I was delighted to be introduced into
Spring Boot by implementing REST API application which was connected on a PostgreSQL
database.

Most important thing was that I saw in action the pattern of dependency injection, parsing
JSON objects, and creating HTTP Requests based on CRUD (POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE).The
course is located [here](https://amigoscode.com/p/spring-boot)
